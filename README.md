# READMe for ExtraCreditEnterpriseAssignment
-This is the extra credit Data Processing and Storage Assignment for CIS 4930: Enterprise Software Engineering Practices

-This project implements a simple in-memory key-value database in C++, with support for transactions. 

#### How to Run the Code

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. This code has been tested with g++ on macOS, but should work on any standard C++ compiler.

2. **Compilation**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the source files (`main.cpp`, `TransactionSupport.cpp`, and `header.h`).
   - Compile the code using the following command:
     ```
     g++ main.cpp TransactionSupport.cpp -o TransactionApp
     ```
   - This command will create an executable named `TransactionApp`.
   - Run the application by executing the following command in the terminal:
     ```
     ./TransactionApp
     ```
   - The program will execute and display the test cases given on the assignment on the terminal.

#### Future Assignment Modifications

To make this assignment into an official assignment I do believe the current assignment would definitely suffice. However, some changes that could be made are to possibly include other methods such as adding to an existing transaction or creating two transactions at once. Another recommendation is to possibly go more in-depth of why this relates to topics we learned in this course. My last recommendation is to possibly had hints on languages that may make this assignment easier as I am most comfortable with C++ however, it may have not been the most efficient method for this type of assigment.
